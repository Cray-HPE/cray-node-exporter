# cray-node-exporter

This repo creates an rpm for installation on UAN nodes for installation.

The .version file in this repo should be updated to stay in sync with the version of the node_exporter
binary being bundled in the rpm.  The latest binary was pulled from:

https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
